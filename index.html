Online menus with photogarphs of the meaps repared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both sutdents and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who aces the canteen can be provided with a School Canteen Acount on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicates for staff members and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/Children's activits in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the schhol, the parent will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps the school keep a record of the student's absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is tored in a database, which can later be checked by the admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's enrollment number or name, details like availibility in classes, number of lectures will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin eneters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and teir parents are pre-informed about the real time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.</p>
